testing out my git skills.


To change to a branch:
git checkout -b `name of the branch`

#these cmds may help me on monday with my repo.
git fetch
git remote add origin `path of repo that i want to push up to`
#this will show which 
git remote -v


#once a file is:   Changed, created brand new
to see if a file is being tracked by git yet:

git status
git add `filename`
git commit -am "PUT A MESG HERE"
git push
